# Real-vs-Fake-News-Using-LSTM

In this notebook, we'll embark on the exciting journey of classifying news articles as either "real" or "fake" using powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. we'll assign the label 1 to represent "real" news and 0 to represent "fake" news.

To tackle this classification task, we'll be using a powerful tool called the BiDirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model. It excels at understanding the meaning of words in a sentence. Additionally, we'll utilize GloVe word embeddings, which will help the model understand word context better. With these tools, we'll analyze news articles and determine which ones are real and which ones are fake.
